scanner to scan banners

This project scan for banners to look for internet connected devices

Things to do - 

1. Massscan command which scan the IPs for well known ports like 80,443,5432,3306 etc
2. Sort the results based on banners and meta tags and store them to the database
3. web based interface which connects to database and filter out the results.

crawler.py:
	The file contains code for masscan that will generate the output xml


parser.py:
	The file will contain the code for parser which consumes output xml generated by the crawler
instance and populate it to the db

database.py:
	The file will contain database related code which can be used by web-instance or parser instance
it have an db object (might be sqlalchemy?) which can be passed around to other instances for db coupling

main.py:
	will tie up everything together.
